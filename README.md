# HotelBudapeste
Desktop system for registering new hotel clients, made with Python (using tkinter) and SQlite.

System for internal hotel use, using basic CRUD commands.
Developed in a few hours, the team made the logo and color palette, which is reminiscent of luxury and curiosity.
In the system, the user can register a new guest, update, delete and list. When a new guest is registered, a frame appears on the right-hand side informing them that the reservation has been made and the room number.
